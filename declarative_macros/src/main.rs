//macros are code that help you write code
//input is code and output is also code transformed in some way
//example println! and vec!
//reduce amount of code we have to write and maintain
//macros accept variable number of parameters
//macros more powerful than functions


fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    let v1: Vec<i32> = vec![1,2 ,3 ];
    let v2: Vec<&str> = vec!["a","b","c","d","e"];

    //these are declarative macros
